# learn_scanner
to automate enumeration, scoped for OSCP/CTFs

## implemented:
- nmap: with IP, port, and option for full scan
- command log (manual echos - is there better way?)
- nmap log (nmap_<target_ip>)

## TODO:
- to read nmap report and check which ports are open
- to read open ports and check services
- to run relevant scan on each service
- multiple target addreses
